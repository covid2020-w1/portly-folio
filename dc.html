                    <p> Broadband Breakfast is an online publication that covers issues of technology with an emphasis on internet connectivity. Even among tech publications, it is non-partisan, its main bias being towards ensuring broadband access to everyone. It is a small company, often with no more than 5 employees. </p>

                    <p> I entered Breakfast with no reporting experience. Over time, I learned how to write up the three different kinds of stories, which represent progressively more complex pieces of journalism.</p>

                <h3>Story #2: Event</h3>
                        <p> I encountered many challenges when I first started reporting. Some questions I recorded after my first event</p>
                        <img id="reporter-questions" src="images/reporter-questions.png">
                        <p>The hardest among them was scrambling to record all of teh nuanced points ocurring in a conversation or panel. A sample of my first notes looked like this</p>
                        <img id="notes-attempt" src="images/notes-attempt.png">
                        <p>back then, my writing was not very organized, accurate, or spelled correctly</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>my ledes, or the opening sentence that summarizes the story and grips people's attention, was not all-together too gripping</p>
                        <img id="lede-bad" src="images/lede-bad.png">
                        <p> after months of working with Broadband, I developed a verbal memory for recording peoples words, developed a shorthand, used a computer whenever i could, and focused almost exclusively on capturing the most important quotes, trusting that the story would arise out of their whole </p>

                            <figcaption>this lede is good bc i used more, longer quotes and summed up the gist in the first sentence</figcaption>

                <h3>Story #3: Enterprise</h3>
                        <p>biggest part is tapping into the sources i cultivated, interviewing (through zoom cause of pandy), getting quotes, and combining with research</p>

                        <p> then I would sift through quotes to find the gems and group them into themes</p>
                        <img src="images/gems.png">
                        <p>by engaging in this process, the heart of the story would naturally emerge</p>
