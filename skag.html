                <h3>What is SEO?</h3>
                <figure>
                    <figcaption> SEO makes your website one of the first blue things that pop up when you Google something. It is often considered a form of free, albeit competitive, marketing. For example, a company that sells leather yoyos would want a page in their website to be the first webpage to appear for the Google search “leather yoyos” and related queries. There are a couple of generally accepted ways to do this.</figcaption>

                <h3>Factors of good SEO</h3>
                <p>Many things factor into what makes you do this. Some websites list hundreds in order of priority. Some of the biggest include how close the title of the webpage matches the search query, whether the search term appears in the page, and the quality of the content on the page </p>
